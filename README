LTL3 tools README
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What you need to properly use the LTL3 tools:
---------------------------------------------

  1. AT&T's fsmlibrary: http://www.research.att.com/~fsmtools/fsm/

  2. LTL2BA: http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~gastin/ltl2ba/

  3. Optional: AT&T's Graphviz, which includes the programs dot, dotty,
     etc.  Note that most modern Linux systems have these preinstalled.

How to run ltl2mon / the LTL3 tools:
------------------------------------

  1. Change into the directory where you extracted the package

  2. Check the settings inside ltl2mon
     (ltl2mon is the main entry point to the LTL3 tools)

  3. Run, for example, "./ltl2mon "(! a) U b" | dot -Tps > graph.ps"

How to compile the LTL3 tools:
------------------------------

If you are on i686 GNU/Linux, you do not have to compile the LTL3
tools as there are some statically linked binaries in the bin/
directory.  Otherwise, follow these steps to compile the LTL3 tools:

  1. Change into the directory where you extracted the package
  
  2. Run "make install"

  Notice, ltl2mon is written in Ocaml.  So, you will need an Ocaml
  tool chain.
