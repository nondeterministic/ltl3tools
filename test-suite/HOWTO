HOWTO - Testing LTL3 tools
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This directory contains some test scripts for the LTL3 tools.  Please
read on to find out what their meaning is and how to test the LTL3
tools.

- rv_properties.txt: That's a collection of LTL formulae for testing
  purposes.  See the comments inside that file for further information
  on them and their origins.

- start.sh: This is the script to compute monitors for all formulae
  in the above file.  If invoked with the -l command line option,
  it will remove all monitors which consist only of a single ?-state.

  The output of this script can be piped into a text file.  Besides,
  it also generates the file gnuplot.dat, if invoked without the -l
  switch, and gnuplot-l.dat otherwise.

- plot.p: This is a gnuplot input file.  Given that the above script
  has generated gnuplot.dat, it generates a Postscript graph of the 
  results.

- reference-gnuplot*.dat: These are the "correct" results that should be
  obtained when running the test with and without -l switch.  If the diff
  between any of these files and a freshly generated .dat file shows any
  differences, then it is likely that some new bug has been introduced
  (e.g., as it happened when switching from version 3.7 to 4.0 of the
  AT&T fsmlibrary).  These files should help detect hard to trace bugs.
